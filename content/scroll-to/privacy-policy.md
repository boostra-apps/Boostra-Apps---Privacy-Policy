# Privacy Policy – Boostra Scroll To

**Last updated: 26/12/2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how Boostra Scroll To ("the app") collects and uses information when a merchant installs and uses the app.

## Information we collect

The app collects limited, non-sensitive data to provide its features:

- **Store information**: shop domain and app installation identifiers.
- **Configuration data**: button settings saved by the merchant (colors, position, visibility rules, icons).
- **Usage analytics (feature of the app)**: anonymized click events on the scroll button, including:
  - Page path (URL path only, without personal customer details)
  - Device type (desktop/mobile)
  - Timestamp of the click

**The app does not collect customer names, emails, addresses, payment information, or sensitive personal data.**

## How we use information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide and operate the app features (display the button based on settings).
- Show analytics inside the app dashboard (click counts, device breakdown, top pages).
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and debug issues.

## Data retention

- Click analytics data is retained for up to **30 days**, then automatically deleted.
- Configuration data is retained while the app remains installed and is deleted after uninstall.

## Sharing of information

We do not sell personal data. We do not share data with third parties except:

- Service providers required to host the app infrastructure (for example, hosting and database providers), under confidentiality obligations.
- When required to comply with applicable laws.

## Merchant choices and deletion

Merchants can uninstall the app at any time to stop data collection.
