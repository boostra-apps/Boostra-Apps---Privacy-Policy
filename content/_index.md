## Complete Features. Fair Pricing. Fast Support.

We're fed up with the same old story: incomplete apps, overpriced subscriptions, and support that takes days to respond. That's why we're building something different.

### What Makes Us Different

**No Feature Limitations**
- Every feature you need is included from day one
- No artificial restrictions or "enterprise-only" functionality
- We build apps the way they should be: complete

**Honest, Fair Pricing**
- No surprise fees or hidden costs
- Starting with 100% free apps (yes, really)
- When we do charge, it's the lowest fair price possible
- No pricing tiers that force you to pay for features you don't need

**Support That Actually Helps**
- Fast email responses at support@boostra-apps.com
- No ticket systems that take 3 days to respond
- Real solutions from people who built the apps
- We're here to help you succeed

**Built for Reliability**
- Following Shopify best practices
- Performance-optimized code
- Privacy-first approach
- Regular updates and maintenance

### Why We Started Boostra Apps

We've seen too many merchants struggle with:
- Apps that promise features but don't deliver
- Monthly fees that add up to hundreds of dollars
- Support teams that don't understand the product
- Apps that slow down stores or collect unnecessary data

We're changing that. One complete, affordable, well-supported app at a time.

### Our First App

**Boostra Scroll To** - A completely free scroll button app with every feature unlocked. No trials, no upgrades, no limitations. Just a great app that does exactly what it should.
